This project implements a complete hardware and firmware solution for controlling a remote-controlled car using physical push buttons. A custom PCB was designed and fabricated in KiCad, integrating an Arduino Nano microcontroller, four tactile push buttons for user input (speed increase/decrease and left/right steering), power regulation circuitry with an LM7805 voltage regulator to convert 12V input to 5V logic level, and dedicated connectors for the BLDC motor and servo motor. The firmware implements PWM-based motor speed control with direction switching, standard RC servo control for steering with configurable angle limits, debounced button input handling with rising edge detection, and safety features including emergency stop and brake functionality. The system provides real-time serial output for monitoring and debugging, making it suitable for educational purposes, RC hobbyists, or as a foundation for autonomous vehicle projects. Control is achieved through SW1 (speed increase), SW2 (speed decrease/brake), SW3 (steer left), and SW4 (steer right), with the Arduino managing BLDC motor control via PWM on pin D3, direction on D4, and brake on D5, while servo steering is controlled via PWM on pin D8. The board accepts 12V power input through a barrel jack connector and includes expansion headers for future ultrasonic sensor integration and autonomous navigation capabilities.
